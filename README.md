# Elder-Care-App

-This is a project that is made for my Android Programming course but it's also a nice portfolio project.

-This project is part of an android workshop.

-The main goal of this project is to learn and implement some concepts of basic Java, advanced Java,
design of an Android App, etc.

-In this project we have two basic type of people: Elders and Volunteers

-The elder asks for help for some activity(ex. Shopping) and Volunteer asks the Elder if he want the help from him. The Elder can accept the help or he can denied the help.
If the Volunteer is accepted, than he can do the activity. When the activity is finished, the Volunteer gives his review and rating for the Elder and vice versa. The Elder
gives the review and rating for the Volunteer.
